## Cloud Automation Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio of hands-on Cloud Automation & DevSecOps (every day a new lab). Each repository showcases practical projects that automate, secure and manage modern cloud environments—covering infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, container and Kubernetes security, monitoring and compliance automation across AWS and Azure.
